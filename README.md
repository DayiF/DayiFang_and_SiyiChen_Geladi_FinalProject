# Final-Project
Siyi Chen and Dayi Fang
Final Project: Partial Least-Squares Regression in Python

We did not use gitub to interact until Thrusday, 04/21/2016. However, we meet twice a week to share and discuss the project and work individually on local files. In case of showing our progress, we will upload everything we have on Friday, 04/22/2016. Some pieces are missing due to the edition of the files. We feel sorry about that and will interact through github in the future.
