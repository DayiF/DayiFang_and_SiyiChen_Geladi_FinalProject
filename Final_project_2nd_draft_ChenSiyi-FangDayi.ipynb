    " \n",
    "The partial least-squares regression method(PLS) is a statistical approach to make a linear regression model by projecting the predicted variables and the observable variables to a new space. By combining features of principal component analysis and multiple regression, PLS is more robust than principal component regression and simple OLS regression when we need a large set of variables with a few samples. \n",
    "In this final project, we implemented, tested and optimized the algorithm in the paper “PARTIAL LEAST SQUARES REGRESSION: A TUTORIAL”[1]. Then we offered a comparison of the code with other popular codes of PLS, followed by sevaral applications of the code in fields of chemistry and economy. "

    "    * If the function is \"minimal\", it is usually worth considering numexpr because there is almost no work to be done\n",
